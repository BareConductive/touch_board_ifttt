# Bare Conductive Simple Touch Board and IFTTT Sketch

[Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) sketch that receives a Bluetooth input from the [Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) and sengs it to [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com/).

## Requirements

* [Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) 3.0+ with HTTP request installed

## Install

1. Close the Processing IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/touch_board_ifttt/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **touch\_board\_ifttt** folder and move it to **Processing Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Processing
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Processing	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Processing
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Processing


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Processing IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
